# JPACRUDProject
This CRUD project is a full stack web application which utilized a mysql database to store climbs. It's scope is currently limited to a single user creating, reading, updating, and/or deleting from a single "climb" entity in a database. 
#Technologies used:

#Lessons Learned
I created this full stack app and database from the 'ground up'. The most signifigant lesson I took from this exercise was the imporntance of proper project organization and planning. Starting from scratch allowed me to understand the different components involved in building a full stack web application and how they interact with each other.
The project also further solidified my undersanding of maping in a CRUD application. I look forward to buililding more complex database models as well as multiple users. I also learned some 'better' bootstrap styling methods.
